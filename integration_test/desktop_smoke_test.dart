// The desktop build, driven on the real desktop embedder.
//
// Everything under test/ runs through `flutter test`, which reports Android —
// so `isDesktop` is false there and desktop_test.dart has to fake the platform
// with debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride. Nothing under test/ has ever loaded
// the GTK, Win32 or Cocoa embedder, the real plugins, or a real window. These
// do, which is the only reason they are worth their minutes.
//
// Native and headless on each platform, which is what the user asked for:
//
//   Linux    xvfb-run -a dbus-run-session -- flutter test integration_test -d linux
//   Windows  flutter test integration_test -d windows   (in a runner session)
//   macOS    flutter test integration_test -d macos     (in a runner session)
//
// Only Linux is headless in the strict sense — a virtual framebuffer, no
// display at all. On Windows and macOS there is a window; it is simply that
// nobody is looking at it. tools/e2e_desktop.sh picks the right one.
